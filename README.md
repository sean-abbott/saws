Simplied AWS (cli)

This cli is not meant to replace the aws cli; it's simply meant to make some common an exploratory tasks easier.

### Why Rust?
I really like single distributable binaries, and while python makes more sense because it's what the aws cli is written in, and go makes a lot of sense, I also want to learn more rust. Plus it should be fast and stable.

### Starting point
Working through this [rust-cli book](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/in-depth/signals.html).
